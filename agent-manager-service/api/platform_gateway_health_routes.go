// RegisterPlatformGatewayHealthRoutes registers the cross-organization gateway
// health surface.
//
// Deliberately not under /orgs/{orgName}: every other route in this table is
// tenant-scoped and takes its org from the token, and a reader has to be able to
// see at a glance that this one is not. The /platform prefix says so, and
// HandleFuncWithValidationAndPlatformAdminAuthz enforces it — it panics at
// startup on an org-scoped pattern.
//
// rbac.GatewayRead is declared because the route needs a permission for its
// audit action label and for the route-table invariants. It is not the control
// here: scope checks short-circuit entirely when RBAC_ENABLED is false, which is
// the default and how cloud runs, so the platform-admin OU check is what
// actually guards this. See middleware.RequirePlatformAdminOU.
