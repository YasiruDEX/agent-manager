// decommissioned gateway is reported as broken forever.
//
// Age never removes a CONNECTED gateway from anything. updated_at is just as old
// on one that has held its connection for months, because nothing writes the
// column while a connection lives, so an age-only rule would drop the healthiest
// gateways in the fleet and inflate the percentage rather than sharpen it. Only
// a gateway that is both old and disconnected is abandoned.

// fleet. A deployment with no gateways at all is healthy — nothing is failing
// when nothing exists.
//
