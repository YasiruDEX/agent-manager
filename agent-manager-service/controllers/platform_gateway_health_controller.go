// GetPlatformGatewayFailureSummary serves the platform-wide gateway failure
// summary: how many gateways exist across every organization, how many have been
// disconnected past the configured staleness threshold, and what share of the
// fleet that is.
//
// The status code carries the verdict, so the route can be pointed at a monitor
// directly: 200 while the failure percentage is under the configured threshold,
// 503 at or above it. Two things about that are deliberate:
//
//   - 503 here describes the gateway fleet, not this service. Anything that
//     alerts on non-2xx responses from agent-manager-service will see these and
//     should exclude this route, or it will read a degraded fleet as a broken
//     control plane.
//   - A detailed request always answers 200. Details are for a human or a
//     dashboard reading the response body, and an error status there would make
//     the payload look like the error rather than the diagnosis. The verdict is
//     still in the body: "healthy" is present on every response, in both forms,
//     and is the field a caller should branch on.
//
// Unlike every other handler here it does not read an org from the request —
// there is no org to read. It deliberately does not call
// middleware.OUIDFromRequest either: this route carries no {orgName}, so the
// registrar never ran RequireOrgMatch and that value would be empty. Reading it
// and passing it as a filter would silently return an empty fleet.
