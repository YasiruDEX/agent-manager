// TestGetPlatformGatewayFailureSummary_RefusesWithoutThePlatformAdminGuard is
// the only test that exercises the handler's fail-closed guard, because no
// correctly-registered route can reach it.
//
// The handler is called DIRECTLY here, with a context that never passed through
// RequirePlatformAdminOU — which is exactly the state a future refactor produces
// by re-registering this route through the ordinary registrar. That mistake
// compiles, passes every routing test, and serves every tenant's rows to any
// authenticated caller. The guard turns it into a 403, and without this test
// nothing proves the guard still works.
//
// Both repository funcs are left nil: an unconfigured moq method panics, so this
// also asserts the refusal happens BEFORE any cross-org query runs.
