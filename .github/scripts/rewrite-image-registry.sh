# Repoint the first-party image repositories in the shipped charts.
# Usage: rewrite-image-registry.sh <from-prefix> <to-prefix>
#   e.g. rewrite-image-registry.sh ghcr.io/wso2 registry.example.com/my-group
#
# Run from the repository root, after update-helm-charts.sh has stamped the
# version. A build that publishes images somewhere other than the public
# registry has to ship charts whose defaults point there, or the operator has to
# override every image by hand.
#
# The rewrite is driven by an explicit allowlist of image names read from
# .github/release-config.json, never by matching the registry prefix. That
# distinction is the whole safety property here: the public org also hosts a
# sibling product (ghcr.io/wso2/api-platform/*), and the charts additionally
# reference ghcr.io/thunder-id and ghcr.io/openchoreo. Those images are not ours
# to move, they are not mirrored to the private registry, and a prefix-based
# sed would silently retag all of them into a registry that has never held them.
#
# amp-python-instrumentation-provider is deliberately NOT in scope even though it
# is first-party. It runs as an init container in namespaces OpenChoreo creates
# at deploy time, where no pull secret can be placed ahead of the pod, so it
# stays on the public registry. See the instrumentation catalog guide for the
# supported way to mirror it.
