# resolve-docs-version.sh — print the documentation version a release points at.
#
# The value is consumed as the path segment after /docs/ (see the console's
# DOCS_URL in the wso2-agent-manager chart), so it must match a directory in
# documentation/versioned_docs/version-<docs-version> and an entry in
# documentation/versions.json exactly. Docs versions are cut per release version,
# so this is just "v" plus the release version.
#
# Prints nothing (exit 0) for releases that cut no docs version: release
# candidates and nightlies follow /docs/latest.
#
# update-helm-charts.sh sources this to stamp the charts, and the promotion
# workflow's validate job runs it to pre-flight the manifest before it cuts
# anything.
