# Fail if an installer fetches this repository's own files over HTTP.
# Run: bash .github/scripts/check-no-raw-github-fetches.sh
#
# Those fetches are what the release bundle exists to replace. They break in
# three ways that are all invisible until an install is already running: GitHub
# rate-limits unauthenticated requests per IP and `helm --values <url>` does not
# retry on the 429, an egress-restricted cluster cannot reach the host at all,
# and a private mirror of this repository serves no public raw URL. Without a
# check they creep back in, because adding one is always the shortest diff.
#
# Two things are deliberately allowed:
#   - a markdown link, [text](url), which a reader clicks to view a file rather
#     than something an install fetches
#   - a defaulted variable, ${AMP_SCRIPT_BASE_URL:-...}, which a fork or an
#     air-gapped mirror can repoint in one place
#   - a shell comment, which documents the curl | bash usage of a script rather
#     than performing a fetch
