# build-vm-bundle.sh — package the combined install bundle attached to a release.
#
# The bundle is a single tarball with everything install-vm.sh / install-advanced.sh /
# start.sh read at runtime, so installers need ONE download instead of a git clone
# plus many raw.githubusercontent fetches (which GitHub rate-limits per IP). It
# reproduces the repo layout so install.sh resolves DEPLOYMENTS_DIR (=deployments/)
# and its single-cluster/values/k8s/scripts siblings exactly as in a checkout.
#
# Also copies bootstrap.sh and start.sh out alongside the tarball so each can be
# attached as its own release asset (the stable curl entry points for the VM and
# quick-start install paths respectively — piping a tarball to bash doesn't work,
# so these stay standalone files even though a copy also lives inside the bundle).
