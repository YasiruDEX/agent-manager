# Covers the shell quoting of the build steps. Argo escapes a substituted
# parameter for JSON, never for the shell, so a parameter carrying user text that
# is interpolated into a step's script becomes shell source: one apostrophe in a
# file mount closes the string early and the rest of the script is reparsed as
# code. The build then dies on a bare `(` far from the real cause and Argo
# reports only a missing output artifact (see issue #1639). A separator such as
# `;` needs no quote at all -- it just runs. The values have to reach the
# container as env vars, which the shell never parses.
#
# Three groups of assertions: the amp-generate-workload step it started with,
# then checkout-source, where the repository URL, branch and commit arrive the
# same way, then the whole chart, since every build step runs `sh -c` over a
# block scalar and the property has to hold for all of them.
