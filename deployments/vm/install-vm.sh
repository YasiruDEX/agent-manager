# install-vm.sh — run ON the target VM (with sudo) to install Agent Manager.
# Usage:
#   sudo ./install-vm.sh --host <PUBLIC_IP> --version <amp-release> \
#                        [--email <addr>] [--no-external-gateways] \
#                        [--registry <host/org>] [--registry-credentials <file>]
#
# --host: the VM's PUBLIC IPv4 address. Public URLs are derived as
#   *.amp.<IP>.sslip.io, and a cloud VM usually can't read its own public IP
#   (it is NAT'd), so pass it explicitly — you already know it (you used it to
#   SSH in).
# --version: the amp/v* release to install (e.g. 0.15.0). Required — the charts
#   and manifests are pulled per-release; there is no sensible default.
#
# --registry / --registry-credentials: install from a private image registry
#   instead of the public default. The credentials file holds
#   AMP_REGISTRY_USERNAME=... and AMP_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=... and should be mode
#   600; they are read from the file rather than the command line because argv
#   is readable by every user on the VM through ps.
#
# TLS is always Let's Encrypt, 443-only: certificates issue via the TLS-ALPN-01
# challenge inside the :443 handshake, so only inbound 443 is required (no port
# 80). The public :443 must reach the VM as raw TCP (no TLS-terminating proxy in
# front). Docker, k3d, kubectl, helm, curl and lsof must already be installed on the
# VM — the installer verifies they are present and exits with install hints if any
# are missing.
