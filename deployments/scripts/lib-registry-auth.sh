# Registry authentication helpers — the SINGLE source of truth for how the
# installers name the image registry and turn registry credentials into the
# artifacts an image pull needs. Meant to be sourced, not executed directly.
#
# Why this is one file: the registry host has to appear in three unrelated
# places — a `docker login` on the host, a containerd `configs:` entry inside
# the k3d node, and a kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson Secret in every namespace
# that runs a first-party image. Getting them out of step does not fail loudly:
# a secret scoped to a different host than the image tag is simply ignored, the
# pull falls back to anonymous and 401s. So the host is derived here once and
# never spelled out again.
#
# Credentials are read from the environment or a file, or prompted for. They are
# deliberately NOT accepted as command-line arguments: argv is readable by every
# user on the host through ps, and lands in shell history.

# Registry prefix (host and organization/project) the first-party AMP images are
# pulled from. Matches the charts' global.ampImageRegistry.

# different script cannot disagree.
