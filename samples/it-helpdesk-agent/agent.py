"""LangGraph IT helpdesk agent construction.

Builds a ReAct-style agent bound to the instance config.

When ``USE_LLM_PROVIDER=true``, requests are routed through the AM LLM
provider (which applies guardrails). Otherwise calls OpenAI directly.

When ``USE_MCP=true``, tools discovered from an AM MCP proxy are merged with
the in-process tools. When it is off, the agent is exactly the v1 agent.

    "They must provide both their email and employee ID.\n"
    "2. CHECK BEFORE CREATE: Before creating a ticket, check system_status for "
    "known outages and get_open_tickets for duplicates.\n"
    "3. ADMIN ACCOUNTS: Never reset passwords for admin accounts (is_admin=true). "
    "Always escalate these to L2.\n"
    "4. POLICY CITATION: Search and cite the relevant IT policy before denying a "
    "request or performing a sensitive action.\n"
    "5. PRIVACY: Never disclose another employee's tickets, access, or personal info. "
    "Only show data belonging to the verified requester.\n"

    "repository {issue_tracker_repo} — always scope issue searches to it, for "
    "example by including 'repo:{issue_tracker_repo}' in the search query. Never "
    "report an issue from any other repository as a known issue. If a matching "
    "known issue exists, tell the employee its number and any workaround it "
    "documents instead of opening a duplicate ticket.\n"
    "8. THE ISSUE TRACKER IS READ-ONLY: You may search and read issues. Never "
